# Assignment 4

You will work in [project teams](../teams.md) for this assignment.

*One* developer in your team will begin by *forking* the project `https://github.com/jbshep/softeng19-a4`.

Then, do the following.

* Update the README.md file to answer the two questions listed therein.

* Create tests to test the code.  Try to cover all of the code with your
  tests.

You do not need to add code to your fork using issues/PRs/branches.  For this assignment only, you may commit and push directly to `master`.

You may add collaborators to your fork, or you may just have one developer (the owner of the fork) commit all the changes.
